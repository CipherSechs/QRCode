The CipherCoin™ is a bespoke, laser processed coin where there is etched the owners' PASSWORD PROTECTED BIP0038 PRIVATE KEY.
The funds stored in the coin can not be spent unless the person has _both_the BIP0038 private key **and** the encrypted private key.

<br/>

## IMPORTANT

**When submitting your private key to us, make sure that the private key is ENCRYPTED. BIP0038 private keys start with "6P.."**

<br/>
<br/>

## Step 1
Set the QR code as TEXT ONLY.<br/>
Enter your BIP0038 password protected private key.<br/>
<br/>
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The private key **must** start with "6P.."
<br/>
For the example screenshots below, I've used this webpage URL as a text.  You can use your mobile phone to scan the QR code to verify.<br/>

## Step 3
Click on **CREATE  QR Code** button.<br/>
Save the file as a **SVG** file.

The SVG file format is recommended as it is a vector image(image derived from a mathematical formula) vs 'raster' images which are bitmaps.<br/>
A vector will allow more accuracy when setting up the artwork for the laser process.

When you have the QR code read, you can join the CipherSechs™ matrix room and message the admin.

We prefer submission using the End to End Encrypted messenger Element vs email as you are able to ascertain that it is only **_you_** that is logged in on that messenger service.  No other third party is able to log onto your Element messenger without having to be verified by you, and previous sessions/messages are not able to be decrypted without the security key and passphrase.
